# JBA Toolkit Webpage

## Introduction

The JBA Toolkit Webpage is a simple, user-friendly static HTML application that provides a set of useful tools. Currently, it features a "Seconds Since Sunday Calculator" and a "Nighttime Locations Display". The webpage is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clear presentation and ease of use.

## Features

### 1. Seconds Since Sunday Calculator

*   **Functionality:** This tool calculates the total number of seconds that have elapsed from Sunday at 00:00:00 to a user-specified day and time within the same week.
*   **How to Use:**
    1.  Select a day of the week from the dropdown menu (Sunday to Saturday).
    2.  Enter a time in the "Time (HH:MM:SS)" input field using the 24-hour format (e.g., `14:30:00` for 2:30 PM).
    3.  Click the "Calculate" button.
    4.  The total seconds will be displayed below the button.
    5.  The input field includes validation for correct time format and value ranges.

### 2. Nighttime Locations Display

*   **Functionality:** This feature displays a dynamic list of international locations where the current local time is between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM. It provides a quick glance at regions likely experiencing late night or early morning hours.
*   **Updates:** The list of locations refreshes automatically every minute to ensure the information is current.
